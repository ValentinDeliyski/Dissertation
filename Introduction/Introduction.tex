\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Aim of the work}

We set out to answer the following question:
\newline

\emph{Is it possible to detect signatures of exotic (a.e. non-Kerr) spacetimes in current and future Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations of supermassive black hole (SMBH) candidates?}
\newline

More specifically, we focus on horizonless spacetimes and pose the following supplementary questions:
\newline

\emph{Can the exotic properties of horizonless spacetimes get encoded in the polarization of light, emitted from the vicinity of compact astrophysical objects? And can this be unambiguously detected by VLBI observations?}
\newline

\emph{Can the exotic properties of horizonless spacetimes get encoded in the morphology of reconstructed from VLBI observations images?}
\newline

The relevancy of these questions and how they fit within the current state of the field of strong gravity physics will be discussed in the following sections of this introduction.
